Fedorov Avtomat — RimWorld Mod by Wololooo
A lore-rich, early automatic rifle from the twilight of Old Earth — rediscovered and rebuilt for survival on the Rim.

The Fedorov Avtomat was one of humanity’s first attempts at a true automatic rifle, developed during the final years of the Russian Empire and deployed in the early mechanized wars of Old Earth. Though crude by modern standards, it laid the foundation for all that came after.

🛰️ Centuries after Earth’s fall, fragments of its schematics were recovered from a derelict military museum ship drifting in the void. Reconstructed by stubborn hands on the Rim, this ancient weapon walks again.

Not advanced. Not efficient. But real — and alive again.
