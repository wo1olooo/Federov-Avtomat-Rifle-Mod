	<description>Recovered from the fragmented memory of a collapsed orbital vault, the Fedorov Avtomat is a ghost from the dawn of automatic warfare — a weapon older than the world that buried it.

Designed in the final years of Old Earth’s First World War, it was one of humanity’s first attempts to arm infantry with select-fire capability. Chambered in a lightweight intermediate cartridge and built with rifle-like ergonomics, the Fedorov was a vision ahead of its time — unstable, underbuilt, but undeniably groundbreaking.

It was retired before the world was ready for it. Forgotten as Earth fell to silence.

Centuries later, its schematics were uncovered among decaying data cores orbiting a dead Rim colony. Reassembled in steel and stubbornness, it lives again.
Not perfect. Not modern. But original.
A first spark, reignited on the edge of the galaxy.
